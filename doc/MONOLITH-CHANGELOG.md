* Fixed non-working adjustable scopes upgrade for weapons

**2023.03.05**:

* Fixed the bug where the weapon with attached adjustable scope and grenade launcher will allow to zoom in with GL. To explicitly enable zooming with active grenade launcher, for whatever reason, add `scope_dynamic_zoom_gl = true` in weapon section in its .ltx file
* Possibility to add shader scopes to alternative sights
  * `scope_dynamic_zoom_alt = true` will enable adjustable scope for alt. sight
  * `scope_texture_alt = <path to texture>` will allow to specify what crosshair to use for alt. sight
* Correct zoom_factor calculation for adjustable scopes with shader scopes enabled, you wont get any extra zoom from shader on top of engine FOV
* `scope_factor` console command that changes zoom by shader scopes now works in real time
* Lowered chromatic abberation and scope blur effect, increasing the quality of image  

**2023.02.20**:

* New SSS update
* New demo-record.diff that contains these changes

  * New console commands:
    * `demo_record_blocked_input 1` will start demo_record but you won't be available to move it or stop it, its intended for manipulation via scripts executing console commands below. The console and Esc key are available
    * `demo_record_stop` will stop all launched `demo_record` commands, including with blocked input ones 
    * `demo_set_cam_direction <head, pitch, roll>` will set the direction the camera is facing and its roll. The parameters are in RADIANS, beware. Use this with `demo_set_cam_position <x, y, z>` to manipulate camera via scripts

**2023.02.18**:

* New SSS update

**2023.02.16**:

* Added `gameobjects_registry` table in `callbacks_gameobject.script` that contains all online game objects and updates accordingly. Additionally, a global iterator `game_objects_iter` added that will go through all online game objects

  end
  ```

**2023.01.28**:

* DLTX received possibility to create section if it doesn't exists and override section if it does with the same symbol `@`.
Below is the example for `newsection` that wasn't defined. Firstly its created with one param `override = false`, then its overriden with `override = true`

```
@[newsection]
override = false

@[newsection]
override = true

```
* Added `bone_direction()` function for game objects
* Updated `lua_help_ex.script` with new functions available

  ```lua
  RegisterScriptCallback("game_object_on_net_spawn", function(obj))
  RegisterScriptCallback("game_object_on_net_destroy", function(obj))
  ```

* DXML will no longer process translation strings of non eng/rus languages, they aren't supported yet
* New lua_help_ex.script file where new engine exports will be described
* Exported additional CWeapon functions considering weapon's RPM, handling and recoil
* Exported functions to get and set actors walk accel and walkback coeff

  ```lua
  db.actor:get_actor_walk_accel()
  db.actor:set_actor_walk_accel(float)
  db.actor:get_actor_walk_back_coef()
  db.actor:set_actor_walk_back_coef(float)
  ```
  * DLTX received possibility to add items to parameter's list if the parameter has structure like 
  
  ```name = item1, item2, item3```
  
    * `>name = item4, item5` will add item4 and item5 to list, the result would be `name = item1, item2, item3, item4, item5`
    * `<name = item3` will remove item3 from the list, the result would be `name = item1, item2`
    * example for mod_system_...ltx: 
    
    ```
      ![info_portions]
      >files                                    = ah_info, info_hidden_threat

      ![dialogs]

    ```

* Exported distance_to_xz_sqr() function of Fvector
* Redesigned duplicate section error, it will additionally print what file adds the section in the first place in addition to the file that has the duplicate
